By going down the witchcraft tree, the player might enlist the help of a familiar. She takes the form of a female cat by the name Snow Crust (working name).

Snow Crust is a chaotic neutral ball of energy that hates the patriarchy and is strongly harmony aligned. The personality I'm aiming for is a mix between the general energy of r/WitchesVsPatriarchy, Pukicho, Il'setsya Wyrmtouched, a friendly grandma, the cheshire cat, an actual cat, and that one fox/seagull griffin that would fight God for half a bagel.

She will train the player in becomming a witch, trading favours for knowledge and power. After each quest you do for her, you get a chunk of crystalized desiderium which you can use to buy things like Magiclysm spell scrolls (although she will only sell spells from balance schools unless you're playing Innawood), ritual books, powerups, as well as lore.

Snow Crust claims to be a spirit, and that the body that the player might form for her is not her true form. She can be resummoned if killed, and is thus quite casual about her own deaths. At first she might also be quite casual about the player's mortality, but she has a tendency to get attached to her witches.

She communicates telepathicly and have a tendency to use kaomojis in her speach. Wearing an item with PSYSHIELD_PARTIAL blocks her from communicatig with you.

You can rub her belly, but if you do so without permision she will claw you and you'll lose standing with her. After completing certain quests, she might reward you with one (1) free belly rub.

female player characters will start friendly with her, while male PCs will start of with her being fairly cold. They can gain reputation with her through questing. If pressed about why, she might snap and explain how two of her previous witches (both which she loved) were burned at the stake by the church. Talking about this is one of the few times she breaks her whimsical character.
