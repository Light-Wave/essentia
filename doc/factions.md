The mod adds two new main factions; The Ethereals, and the Lords of the Moon.

# The Ethereals
Inspired by the Unbidden from Stellaris, the Ethereals are humanoid psionic constructs surounding a hard core the size of a chicken egg. Rather than food or water, they consume souls to sustain themselves (Or some sort of psionic energy released upon death, it might be a bit unclear). They are strongly domination aligned, and will be hostile to most other lifeforms. They don't care to hunt robots since the Etherals can't eat them, and they have a begrudging respect for Mi-Go due to a shared intrest in the domination side of magic, and having proved themselves mighty wariors.
If the player show themselves to be strong enough in the dominion side of things by advancing though thaumatology, they might warm up and allow some quests. For rewards, they might offer domination school spell scrolls, or Ethereal tech that is near weightless but drains the user's mana while active.
They are capable of interdimensional travel, and prefer to do so in ships spun out of the same ethereal psionic construct that makes up their bodies.
They can be slain but holds little hard feeling over that, as they believe that it is the strong's right to consume the weak.

# The Lords of the Moon
Mysterious beings that reside on a moon that is not fully inside our reality, these guys might occationally come down to trade during portal storms, selling harmony spell scrolls and other things. Different individuals have different domains that they trade in. They can also be contacted though mirrors and mirrored surfaces, but only outside during night when the moon is visible in the sky.
Their true goals are mysterious, but they seem to desire to collect desiderium essentia, and also seem interested in spreading the workship of the moon.

## Familiars
Familiars such as the one the player might enlist serve the Lords of the Moon with varying degrees of loyalty. They can be contacted through mirrors as mentioned above.
